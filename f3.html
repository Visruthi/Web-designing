<div class="content"><center><p class="abt">A flower bouquet is a collection of flowers in a creative arrangement. Flower bouquets can be arranged for the decor of homes or public buildings, or may be handheld. Handheld bouquets are classified by several different popular shapes and styles, including nosegay, crescent, and cascading bouquets. Flower bouquets are often given for special occasions such as birthdays or anniversaries. They are also used extensively in weddings. Bouquets arranged in vases or planters for home decor can be arranged in either traditional or modern styles. Symbolism may be attached to the types of flowers used, according to the culture.<br />1.Flowers are the sweetest things God ever made, and forgot to put a soul into.<br /> 
2.Earth laughs in flowers.<br />
3.I'd rather have roses on my table than diamonds on my neck.<br />
4.People from a planet without flowers would think we must be mad with joy the whole time to have such things about us.<br />
5.For myself I hold no preferences among flowers, so long as they are wild, free, spontaneous. Bricks to all greenhouses! Black thumb and cutworm to the potted plant! <br />
